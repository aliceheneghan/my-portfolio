                        The first known use of the word <i>computer</i> was in 1613 and it meant 'one that computes'<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Since then, we know that human computers helped to calculate such things as the orbit of Halley's comet in 1758 and that in 1875 the first three Harvard Computers were hired <a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The latter were an all women team that grew anywhere between 40 and 80 individuals over the next few decades, most likely due to the fact they could be paid "as little as less than half of what men got"<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>.

                        In the 1940s the <a href="https://ethw.org/Women_Computers_in_World_War_II">role of women in computing</a> had become commonplace despite History's dismissal of them. In 1946, the first computer program produced by six female programmers was demonstrated at the unveiling of <a href="https://ethw.org/Women_Computers_in_World_War_II">ENIAC</a> but not long after the women were taken off the project when the machine was moved to a military base.

                        When rediscovering these forgotten women, we must remember that society has been even less kind to women of colour. Thankfully, issues of gender and race are slowly being redressed and the 2016 film <i>Hidden Figures</i> tells the story of the African-American team of females that did vital work for NASA's early space program.

                    <p>In the 90s however, the girls were fighting back and grrr were they feisty. In 1991 Adelaide, Australia, a few of them got together to form the <a href="https://vnsmatrix.net/">VNS Matrix collective</a> and launched <a href="https://vnsmatrix.net/projects/the-cyberfeminist-manifesto-for-the-21st-century">The Cyber Feminist Manifesto for the 21st Century</a>  that packed a punch! It was THE era of zines and manifestos. You can find out more about the whole movement <a href="https://monoskop.org/Cyberfeminism">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>
                        Alongside the cyber feminists the Riot Grrrls were also kicking up dust. The 90s saw an explosion of punk rock girlbands such as <i>Hole</i>, <i>Babes In Toyland</i> and of course, <i>Bikini Kill</i> who published <i>their</i> <a href="https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/riotgrrrlmanifesto.html">manifesto</a> in 1991 and released the iconic 'Rebel Girl' track in 1992. The movements were closely linked and the message was, make noise, make waves and DoItYourself! In a return to girlish self-esteem <a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> and silliness, these women were taking up subculture space in a big way.

                    <p>
                        Born in the 90s myself, it was only in my adult years that I was awakened to the rich history of women and computers when I visited the 2019 <a href="https://gaite-lyrique.net/storage/2019/04/04/computer-grrrls-exhibition-leaflet-english.pdf">Computer Grrrls Exhibition</a> and it blew my socks off. So much so it inspired me to make this page 3 years later. 23 international artists let their imaginations off the leash in order to tackle History, Gender and Technology through art. Below is an unsettling yet hilarious ASMR presentation of the <i>Robotron KC87</i> made by <i>Nadja Buttendorf</i> but if you want to know more about the exhbition, you can read the magazine <a href="https://hmkv.de/files/hmkv/ausstellungen/03_Archiv/2018/GRLS/05_Publikation/GRLS_Magazin_digital_mit_Cover.pdf">here</a>.
